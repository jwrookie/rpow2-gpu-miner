# rpow2 GPU Miner

A fast, cross-platform GPU miner for [**rpow2**](https://rpow2.com) — the modern tribute to Hal Finney's original [Reusable Proofs of Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hashcash#Reusable_proofs_of_work). Compiles a Vulkan compute shader on the fly and mines on **any modern GPU** (AMD, NVIDIA, Intel — discrete *or* integrated). No CUDA toolkit, no ROCm install, no driver fiddling.

## Why GPU mine rpow2?

The on-site browser miner uses a wasm SHA-256 implementation pinned to a single CPU thread. That's perfect for the in-browser experience, but it leaves three to four orders of magnitude of throughput on the floor on any machine with a real GPU.

| Miner | Typical throughput | Time per token at 25 bits |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Browser tab (`hash-wasm` SHA-256, single thread) | ~1 MH/s | ~33 s |
| Modest desktop CPU (e.g. Ryzen 5, OpenSSL SHA-NI) | ~150 MH/s | ~0.2 s |
| **This miner**, integrated GPU (e.g. Iris Xe, Radeon 780M) | **~300 MH/s** | **~0.1 s** |
| **This miner**, mid-range discrete GPU (e.g. RTX 3060, RX 6600) | **~1–2 GH/s** | **~16–33 ms** |
| **This miner**, high-end GPU (e.g. RTX 4080, RX 7900) | **~3–5 GH/s** | **~7–11 ms** |

Numbers are wall-clock against the live `api.rpow2.com` endpoint, so they include HTTP round-trip on top of the kernel.

## Features

- **One-file Python miner.** Just `pip install` and run.
- **Real GPU mining** via Vulkan compute. No CUDA SDK, no ROCm, no shader compiler in the path — the kernel is JIT-compiled to SPIR-V the first time it runs.
- **Cross-vendor:** AMD (RDNA1+), NVIDIA (Maxwell+), Intel (Gen9+), Apple (M-series with MoltenVK), even most integrated GPUs and the Steam Deck.
- **Zero protocol divergence.** Bit-identical to the on-site browser worker — every solution is verified on the CPU with `hashlib` before submission.
- **Stateless and minimal.** Single Python file (~250 lines), stdlib HTTP, two pip deps (`taichi`, `numpy`).
- **Safe by default.** Won't run without an explicit cookie, prints what account it's mining for, supports `--rounds N` to stop after a fixed number of mints, graceful summary on `Ctrl-C`.

## Hardware support

| GPU vendor | Linux | Windows | WSL2 | macOS |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| AMD (RDNA, RDNA2, RDNA3) | ✓ via Mesa `radv` | ✓ via AMD driver | ✓ via WSLg | n/a |
| NVIDIA (Maxwell+) | ✓ proprietary or open driver | ✓ | ✓ via WSLg | n/a |
| Intel (Gen9+ / Arc) | ✓ via `anv` (Mesa) | ✓ | ✓ via WSLg | n/a |
| Apple Silicon | n/a | n/a | n/a | ✓ via MoltenVK |
| Integrated graphics (Vega, Iris, Radeon 700M/800M, etc.) | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ | ✓ |

If `vulkaninfo` lists your GPU, this miner will run on it.

**WSL1 is not supported** — there's no GPU passthrough on WSL1. See the [WSL2 setup section](#running-on-wsl2-windows) below if you're on Windows.

---

## Install

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ImMike/rpow2-gpu-miner.git
cd rpow2-gpu-miner

python -m venv .venv
source .venv/bin/activate          # or `.venv\Scripts\activate` on Windows
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

That's it. Taichi ships its own SPIR-V toolchain inside its wheel — you don't need `glslc`, `shaderc`, or any vendor SDK.

### Linux note

You'll need a Vulkan loader and a vendor ICD installed. On Ubuntu/Debian:

```bash
sudo apt install libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers     # AMD/Intel
# or, for NVIDIA, the proprietary driver already ships its own ICD
```

Verify with `ls /usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/` — you should see at least one `*_icd.*.json`.

### Running on WSL2 (Windows)

This miner runs on Windows via WSL2 with full GPU acceleration. The trick is that the GPU driver lives on the **Windows side**, not inside the Linux distro — WSL2 forwards Vulkan calls to the host driver through `/dev/dxg`.

**One-time setup:**

1. Confirm you're on **WSL2**, not WSL1. From PowerShell:
   ```powershell
   wsl -l -v
   ```
   The `VERSION` column must say `2`. If it says `1`, convert with `wsl --set-version <distro> 2`.
2. Update WSL itself (PowerShell as admin):
   ```powershell
   wsl --update
   ```
3. Install the **WSL-aware GPU driver on Windows** (not inside WSL):
   - **NVIDIA:** any Game Ready or Studio driver from version 470 onward ships with WSL2 GPU support out of the box.
   - **AMD:** Adrenalin 22.20.x or newer.
   - **Intel Arc / Iris Xe:** driver `30.0.101.1660` or newer.
4. Inside your WSL2 distro (Ubuntu/Debian shown):
   ```bash
   sudo apt update
   sudo apt install -y libvulkan1 mesa-vulkan-drivers vulkan-tools
   ```
   > Do **not** install a Linux-side GPU driver such as `amdgpu-pro`, `nvidia-driver-*`, or `intel-opencl-icd` inside WSL — those conflict with the WSLg path.
5. Verify the host GPU is visible from inside WSL:
   ```bash
   vulkaninfo --summary
   ```
   You should see your real card listed (NVIDIA RTX..., AMD Radeon..., Intel Arc...). If you only see `llvmpipe` (CPU software fallback), the host driver bridge isn't active — see troubleshooting below.
6. From there, install and run the miner exactly like native Linux:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   export RPOW_COOKIE='rpow_session=...'
   python rpow2_gpu_miner.py
   ```

**Expected performance:** typically 5–15 % slower than the same GPU on bare-metal Linux (the cost of the WSL2/D3D12 translation layer). Still ~1000× faster than the in-browser miner.

**WSL2 troubleshooting:**

- `vulkaninfo --summary` only shows `llvmpipe` → the WSLg GPU bridge isn't active. Run `wsl --shutdown` from PowerShell, reopen the distro, and re-check. If still broken, the most common cause is a stale or missing host driver (re-do step 3).
- `ls /usr/lib/wsl/lib/` is empty → `wsl --update` didn't take. Re-run it as admin.
- Performance feels suspiciously low (`<100 MH/s` on a discrete GPU) → you're probably running on `llvmpipe`. Same fix as above.

## Get your session cookie

The miner authenticates the same way your browser does — by carrying the `rpow_session` cookie. To grab yours:

1. Sign in to [rpow2.com](https://rpow2.com) with your email (you'll get a magic link).
2. Open DevTools (F12 in most browsers) and switch to the **Network** tab.
3. Click the **MINE** button on the site once. You'll see a `POST` request to `api.rpow2.com/challenge`.
4. Click that request → **Headers** → **Request Headers** → copy the entire `cookie:` value. It will start with `rpow_session=…`.

Then expose it to the miner:

```bash
export RPOW_COOKIE='rpow_session=eyJ…paste-the-whole-thing…'
```

> Treat this cookie like a password. It identifies your account to the network until it expires.

---

## Quick start

```bash
# Mine continuously until you Ctrl-C:
python rpow2_gpu_miner.py

# Mine exactly 100 tokens and exit:
python rpow2_gpu_miner.py --rounds 100

# Quiet mode (only the summary at the end):
python rpow2_gpu_miner.py --rounds 100 --quiet

# Local GPU-only benchmark, no rpow2 cookie or network needed:
python rpow2_gpu_miner.py --benchmark 5

# Keep fast GPUs busier by solving several outstanding challenges per batch:
python rpow2_gpu_miner.py --pipeline 8
```

`--help` lists every flag.

---

## How it works

rpow2's proof-of-work is a single-block SHA-256 with a "trailing zero bits" target:

```
preimage  = nonce_prefix_bytes || little_endian_uint64(nonce)
digest    = SHA256(preimage)
accept    iff trailing_zero_bits(digest) >= difficulty_bits
```

`nonce_prefix` is a 16-byte value the server hands out per challenge, and `difficulty_bits` is the current network target (you'll see it in every `/challenge` response). Each token mint is an independent puzzle. The full mining flow is:

```
client                                  api.rpow2.com
  |  POST /challenge                       |
  | -------------------------------------> |
  |  { challenge_id, nonce_prefix, bits }  |
  | <------------------------------------- |
  |                                        |
  | (search for nonce on GPU)              |
  |                                        |
  |  POST /mint { challenge_id, nonce }    |
  | -------------------------------------> |
  |  { token: { id, value, issued_at } }   |
  | <------------------------------------- |
```

This miner expresses the same SHA-256 round function in Taichi's Python-with-decorators kernel language. At import time, Taichi JIT-compiles it into a SPIR-V compute shader and dispatches it through Vulkan. Each kernel launch fans out to ~67 million attempts (1,048,576 threads × 64 nonces per thread by default — tune with `--threads` and `--iters`).

Every nonce the kernel marks as a candidate is independently re-hashed on the CPU with Python's `hashlib.sha256` before the miner posts to `/mint`. That means a kernel bug (or a flaky GPU memory module) results in a clean failure, never an invalid submission.

---

## Performance tuning

The defaults work well from integrated graphics up through high-end discrete cards. If you want to squeeze the last few percent:

- **Measure the kernel without HTTP first.** `python rpow2_gpu_miner.py --benchmark 5` reports local MH/s/GH/s. If this is low, tune `--threads`/`--iters` or check that Vulkan is using the real GPU.
- **Pipeline live mining when GPU utilization looks idle.** `--pipeline 4`, `--pipeline 8`, or `--pipeline 16` requests several challenges, solves them in one GPU batch, and posts the mints concurrently. This improves average GPU occupancy when each individual PoW is shorter than the HTTP round trip. The default stays `--pipeline 1` for maximum protocol compatibility.
- **More threads, same iters.** `--threads 4194304 --iters 16` keeps total work the same but flattens the parallel dimension. Helps on cards with high SM/CU count.
- **More iters, same threads.** `--iters 256` reduces per-launch dispatch overhead. Helps on integrated GPUs where launch latency dominates.
- **Power efficiency vs latency.** Lower `--threads` reduces tail latency on each PoW; higher `--threads` reduces the number of kernel launches per token at the cost of "wasted" work after a candidate is found.

A reasonable sweep:

```bash
for t in 262144 1048576 4194304; do
  for i in 16 64 256; do
    python rpow2_gpu_miner.py --rounds 5 --threads $t --iters $i --quiet
  done
done
```

If the benchmark shows strong GH/s but live mining still shows near-zero GPU utilization, the bottleneck is not the kernel; use `--pipeline 8` and increase or decrease from there depending on server rate limits.

## Verifying a solution

`verify.py` is a zero-dependency CPU verifier (just `hashlib`) for any rpow2 PoW solution. Useful for cross-checking another miner's output, or debugging your own kernel.

```bash
python verify.py <prefix_hex> <nonce_decimal> <difficulty_bits>
```

Example:

```bash
$ python verify.py deadbeefcafef00d11223344556677ee 540224 16
preimage    deadbeefcafef00d11223344556677ee403e080000000000
sha256      1d1770fc5adb902a9c6da3dd4a6ba6a3e96961e8306cdd8cd57ff500f43d0000
trailing 0s 16  (target >= 16)
```

Exit code 0 if the solution meets the target, 1 otherwise.

## FAQ

**Q: Do I need root / admin?**
No. Vulkan ICDs are usually pre-installed on every desktop OS. You only need elevated privileges if you have to install Mesa or a vendor driver.

**Q: Will this work on a laptop with only integrated graphics?**
Yes. Modern integrated GPUs (Intel Iris Xe, AMD Radeon 780M / 880M, Apple M-series) typically deliver 200–500 MH/s on this kernel — comfortably faster than even a fast CPU on the in-browser miner.

**Q: Does it work on Windows / WSL?**
Yes on **WSL2** with WSLg (Windows 10 21H2+ or Windows 11) — full GPU acceleration via the host driver, see [Running on WSL2 (Windows)](#running-on-wsl2-windows). **No on WSL1**: WSL1 has no GPU passthrough at all. Native Windows (without WSL) also works if you install Python and a Vulkan-capable GPU driver.

**Q: It says "WebAssembly is not supported in this environment". Help?**
That's the in-browser miner's error, not this one. This Python miner doesn't use WebAssembly.

**Q: Can I run multiple instances on the same machine?**
Yes, though one process per GPU is enough — the kernel already saturates the device. If you have multiple GPUs and want to use them all, Taichi will pick one based on the order Vulkan enumerates them; set `VK_ICD_FILENAMES` to point at a single ICD JSON to pin a specific device.

**Q: Can I mine multiple accounts in parallel?**
Each instance binds to one cookie. Run as many instances as you have cookies, but please be a good citizen and don't sybil-flood the network — it makes mining harder for everyone (including you) by raising effective difficulty.

**Q: Does this work with the rpow2 testnet / a fork?**
Yes — set `RPOW_API_BASE` and `RPOW_ORIGIN` to the URLs of your fork before running. Both default to the public network.

**Q: Why Vulkan and not OpenCL / CUDA / Metal?**
Vulkan compute runs everywhere with one set of code. OpenCL has uneven driver support on consumer hardware, CUDA is NVIDIA-only, Metal is Apple-only. Taichi targets all three, and Vulkan is the lowest-friction choice for "works on any modern GPU."

---

## Troubleshooting

**`RuntimeError: [Taichi] No Vulkan device found`**
Your Vulkan loader isn't seeing any GPU. Check `vulkaninfo --summary` (Linux/Windows) or `system_profiler SPDisplaysDataType` (macOS). On Linux, install `mesa-vulkan-drivers` for AMD/Intel or the proprietary NVIDIA driver. Make sure `/usr/share/vulkan/icd.d/` has at least one ICD JSON.

**`auth check failed: http 401`**
Cookie expired or invalid. Re-grab it from your browser (see [Get your session cookie](#get-your-session-cookie)).

**`/challenge` is slow (10+ seconds per request)**
The network is rate-limiting your account or is genuinely overloaded. Both the rate-limit and the overload are server-side and there's nothing the client can do about them — just wait it out, or mine slower.

**Kernel JIT compile takes a long time (5–10 s)**
Normal on the first launch only. Taichi caches the compiled SPIR-V in `~/.cache/taichi/`; subsequent runs start in ~1 s.

## Contributing

PRs welcome. A few low-hanging fruit:

- A native CUDA kernel for NVIDIA cards (typically 2–3× the Vulkan path).
- A native ROCm/HIP kernel for AMD cards (similar gains).
- A Web Worker version that does what the on-site miner does but on the browser's `WebGPU` (where available) instead of WASM SHA-256.
- A `--multi-gpu` flag that round-robins challenges across all enumerated devices.

Please run `python verify.py` on a handful of solutions before opening a PR that touches the kernel — that's the easy guardrail against subtle SHA-256 bugs.
